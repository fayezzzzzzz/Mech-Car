<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>The automotive industry is continually striving to enhance vehicle performance and fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency, commonly measured in miles per gallon (mpg), is a critical aspect that affects consumer preferences, regulatory compliance, and environmental sustainability. Various factors influence a vehicle's fuel efficiency, including its design, weight, and technological features. This study aims to analyze the relationship between mpg and five key independent variables: vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and all-wheel drive (AWD).</p>

<p>2. Objective</p>
<p>To analyze and identify the key factors among vehicle_length, vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, ground_clearance, and AWD that significantly impact the fuel efficiency of vehicles. By understanding these relationships, the company can make informed decisions on vehicle design and engineering to optimize fuel efficiency
